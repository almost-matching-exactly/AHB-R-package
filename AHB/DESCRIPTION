Description: Efficient implementations of the algorithms in in causal inference for 
    interpretable matching. These algorithms matches units with others in unit-specific, 
    hyper-box-shaped regions of the covariate space. They learn matched groups adaptively,
    works for mixed categorical and continuous datasets, and produces low-variance matched
    groups that can be described with interpretable rules. For more information and examples,
    see the Almost-Matching-Exactly website.
